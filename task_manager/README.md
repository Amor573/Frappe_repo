This repository contains the setup and development process for a Frappe-based backend application. The goal is to develop and manage backend applications using the Frappe Framework, including API development, database schema design, performance optimization, and debugging.
Why Use GitHub Codespaces Instead of a Local Machine?
Using GitHub Codespaces for setting up and running Frappe offers several benefits over a local machine:
1. Quick Setup - Codespaces provides a pre-configured environment with essential dependencies, reducing setup time.
2. Consistency - Ensures that all developers work with the same system configurations, preventing conflicts between different local setups.
3. Cloud-Based - Eliminates the need for high-end local resources, as Codespaces runs on cloud infrastructure.
4. Security - Provides an isolated and secure environment, minimizing the risk of breaking local system dependencies.
5. Collaboration - Allows seamless sharing of workspaces with team members, making pair programming and debugging easier.

Task 1: Frappe Application Setup
Prerequisites
Before setting up Frappe, ensure you have:
* A GitHub account
* GitHub Codespaces enabled
Steps to Set Up a Frappe Application
1. Open a GitHub Codespace
    * Navigate to your repository in GitHub.
    * Click on the Code button and select Codespaces.
    * Click Create Codespace on main.
2. Install Frappe Bench sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-dev python3-pip python3-venv git
3. pip install frappe-bench
4. Initialize a Frappe Bench Instance bench init frappe-bench --frappe-branch version-14
5. cd frappe-bench
6. Create a New Frappe Site bench new-site frappe-task
7. Start the Frappe Development Server bench start
Expected Output
Once the setup is complete, the server should start, and you should see logs indicating that Frappe is running.
